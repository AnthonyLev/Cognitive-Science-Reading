Why Positive Frames?

>This work was inspired by the need to escape the negative patterns of thinking that began to overwhelm the authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We realized that what we needed was not some naive belief that everything would be okay if we ignored our problems. Instead, we needed *reframing*, or a shift in focus, with less weight on the negative things we can't control, and more weight on the positive things about ourselves and our situation which we can control.

>*Positive reframing* induces a complementary positive viewpoint (e.g. glass-half-full), which nevertheless supports the underlying content of the original sentence (see diagram above). The reframe implicates rather than contradicts the source, and the transformation is motivated by theoretically justified strategies from positive psychology (see *What's 'in the box?'*).

>Our work shows how NLP can help lead the way by automatically reframing overly negative text using strategies from positive psychology.

abstract

> Sentiment transfer is one popular example of a text style transfer task, where the goal is to reverse the sentiment polarity of a text. With a sentiment reversal comes also a reversal in meaning. We introduce a different but related task called positive reframing in which we neutralize a negative point of view and generate a more positive perspective for the author without contradicting the original meaning. Our insistence on meaning preservation makes positive reframing a challenging and semantically rich task. To facilitate rapid progress, we introduce a large-scale benchmark, POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY FRAMES, with 8,349 sentence pairs and 12,755 structured annotations to explain positive reframing in terms of six theoreticallymotivated reframing strategies. Then we evaluate a set of state-of-the-art text style transfer models, and conclude by discussing key challenges and directions for future work. 

### Gratitude and depressive symptoms: The role of positive reframing and positive emotion.

abstract

>Eight studies (N=2,973) tested the theory that gratitude is related to fewer depressive symptoms through positive reframing and positive emotion. Study 1 found a direct path between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Studies 2-5 demonstrated that positive reframing mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Studies 6-7 showed that positive emotion mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. Study 8 found that positive reframing and positive emotion simultaneously mediated the relationship between gratitude and depressive symptoms. In sum, these eight studies demonstrate that gratitude is related to fewer depressive symptoms, with positive reframing and positive emotion serving as mechanisms that account for this relationship.

### Benefits of expressive writing in lowering rumination and depressive symptoms

Abstract

> Depression-vulnerable college students (with both elevated prior depressive symptoms and low current depressive symptoms) wrote on 3 consecutive days in either an expressive writing or a control condition. As predicted, participants scoring above the median on the suppression scale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003) showed significantly lower depression symptoms at the 6-month assessment when they wrote in the expressive writing versus the control condition. Additional analyses revealed that treatment benefits were mediated by changes in the Brooding but not the Reflection scale of the Ruminative Response Scale (Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991). A "booster" writing session predicted to enhance treatment benefits failed to have a significant effect.

### Can the use of writing lower rumination of negative thoughts in depressed adults?

Abstract: 

> Background and aims: The results of James Pennebaker's 1993 study into the effect of writing on the health of college undergraduates showed significant improvements to the immune system and, subsequently, the writing model has been researched in a number of health care contexts with significant results. Pennebaker revised this model of writing (1997) and it has since been implemented by health professionals in the treatment of depression where negative, recurring thoughts are problematic, with positive outcomes. This review describes and compares two similar randomized control trials (RCTs) using the three day writing model for reducing ruminative thought in depressed adults. Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken to elicit RCTs measuring the effect of using writing for people presenting with rumination in depression. Findings: Results showed that expressive writing moderated maladaptive ruminative styles of thinking and significantly reduced depressive symptoms at the follow-up assessment. The term 'rumination' is complex and relevant in the study of symptoms where depressed patients suffer with negative recurring thoughts. Conclusion: Pennebaker's writing method may be a useful tool for practitioners working in therapy and rehabilitation for adults suffering with depression with a tendency to ruminate. Further discussion and research within a mental health context are required.

### Expressive writing buffers against maladaptive rumination.

Abstract

> This study examined whether ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing. Sixty-nine participants were assessed for ruminative style and depression symptoms at the beginning of their 1st college semester. Participants were then randomized to either an expressive writing or a control writing condition. Changes in depression symptoms were assessed 2, 4, and 6 months later. Results showed that a brooding ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing such that among those assigned to the expressive writing condition, individuals with greater brooding scores reported significantly fewer depression symptoms at all of the follow-up assessments relative to individuals with lower brooding scores. In contrast, reflective pondering ruminative style did not moderate the effects of expressive writing on depression symptoms. These findings suggest that expressive writing could be used as a means of reducing depression symptoms among those with a maladaptive ruminative tendency to brood.

### Training Positive Rumination in Expressive Writing to Enhance Psychological Adjustment and Working Memory Updating for Maladaptive Ruminators

abstract

>Rumination is associated with psychological adjustment and working memory (WM) capacity. Studies have shown that psychological interventions can reduce negative rumination and improve psychological adjustment and WM capacity. The present study investigated the effect of positive rumination training in expressive writing on psychological adjustment and WM updating capacity. Within an experimental design, positive rumination was manipulated for 10 participants who were maladaptive ruminators in an experiment using a 5-week training compared to the control group with nine participants. Results revealed significant enhancement of psychological adjustment and the response time (RT) of WM updating in the experimental group but not in the control group. The two groups did not show significant difference of all the variables in pretest. However, the experimental group showed significantly better outcomes than the control group in posttest. The results suggest that positive rumination training in expressive writing is effective and rumination has a causal influence on WM updating capacity.



### Expressive Writing

Expressive writing refers to the procedure of writing about emotionally upsetting experiences without paying attention to grammar or spelling ([Pennebaker and Beall, 1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B29)). Previous studies have shown inconsistent findings regarding its effect on psychological adjustment. For example, in a systematic review, [Riddle et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B33) found a significant effect of expressive writing on reducing trauma and improving general psychological health for caregivers but no effect on changing their depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, quality of life, or burden. Relatedly, in a systematic review, [Lee et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B19) found that expressive writing improved the quality of life for women with breast cancer, but did not reduce their negative emotions. They then pointed out the “importance of modifying the traditional expressive writing protocol to enhance its efficacy” (p. 99). Furthermore, in a recent meta-analysis, [Reinhold et al. (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B32) found no significant long-term effects of expressive writing on depressive symptoms. However, the higher number of sessions and the more specific writing topic produced larger effects. Therefore, they proposed that brief, self-directed expressive writing should not be considered as an effective method to decrease depressive symptoms in physically healthy adults and that future research should employ longer and counselor-directed expressive writing.

Regarding the effects of expressive writing on rumination, [Gortner et al. (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B15) found that writing for 20 min on 3 consecutive days significantly reduced depression level 6 months later. This effect was mediated by changes of brooding. Relatedly, [Sloan et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B36) found that the same number of sessions significantly reduced depression 2, 4, and 6 months later. Brooding ruminative style moderated the effects of expressive writing such that participants with higher brooding scores reported significantly lower depression level relative to those with lower brooding scores. Recently, [Glass et al. (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237754/#B14) found that a modified framework of expressive writing significantly reduced rumination for adults who had a trauma, or significant emotional/physical upheaval, within the past year.

These findings suggest that expressive writing could be modified to reduce negative rumination such as brooding.

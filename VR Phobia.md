abstract:

> goal: This study explored whether virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy was effective in the treatment of spider phobia. We compared a treatment condition vs. a waiting list condition in a between group design with 23 participants. Participants in the VR treatment group received an average of four one-hour exposure therapy sessions. VR exposure was effective in treating spider phobia compared to a control condition as measured with a Fear of Spiders questionnaire, a Behavioural Avoidance Test (BAT), and severity ratings made by the clinician and an independent assessor. Eighty-three percent of patients in the VR treatment group showed clinically significant improvement compared with 0% in the waiting list group, and no patients dropped out. This study shows that VR exposure can be effective in the treatment of phobias.

background

> Unfortunately, around 60–85% of those afflicted with specific phobias never seek treatment for their problem ([Agras, Sylvester, & Oliveau, 1969](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB1); [Boyd et al., 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB7), [Magee et al., 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB20)).

result

> Pilot studies and case reports suggest that VR exposure therapy can be an effective medium for the reduction of specific phobias such as fear of heights ([Rothbaum et al., 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB32)), fear of flying ([Hodges, Rothbaum, Watson, Kessler, & Opdyke, 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB15)), claustrophobia ([Botella et al., 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB4); [Botella, Baños, Villa, Perpiñà, & Garcia-Palacios, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB5)) and spider phobia ([Carlin, Hoffman, & Weghorst, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB8)). Recent controlled studies have shown that VR exposure therapy was as effective as in vivo exposure to treat flying phobia ([Rothbaum, Hodges, Smith, Lee, & Price, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB33)) and fear of heights ([Emmelkamp et al., in press](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701000687#BIB12)).

Importance:

> Virtual reality in head-mounted displays (HMD-VR) may be a valuable tool in occupational therapy to address anxiety. Findings from the virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) literature may facilitate translation of HMD-VR to occupational therapy psychosocial practice.

Objective: 

> To explore how HMD-VR has been used to treat anxiety through VRET and could be translated to occupational therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance: 

> HMD-VR can be a valuable tool for occupational therapy to simulate environments where clients with anxiety disorders participate. Eliciting presence through multisensory features and body representation may enhance outcomes.

What This Article Adds: 

> Drawing from the VRET literature, this scoping review suggests that HMD-VR can be used by occupational therapy practitioners to simulate ecologically valid environments, evaluate client responses to fearful stimuli, and remediate anxiety though immersion in virtual tasks when participation in natural contexts is unfeasible. Having ecologically valid environments is particularly important for people with anxiety disorders because they need support to cope when they encounter triggers in everyday life environments.

The advantages of using VR

> A convenient and affordable alternative for enhancing patient outcomes is exposing patients to realistic simulations of these environments through immersive virtual reality (VR), which provides “artificially generated sensory information in a form that people perceive as similar to real-world objects or events” ([Wilson et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib49), p. 213).

> One approach that can be implemented in VR to treat anxiety is exposure therapy, which helps clients confront fear-inducing stimuli through guided exposures and is often paired with cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT; [American Psychological Association, Society of Clinical Psychology [APA-SCP\], 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3a)). It is client-centered and facilitates habituation, extinction of associations with fearful stimuli, self-efficacy, emotional processing, and participation in life activities ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)). Exposure can take place in several forms: (1) in vivo exposure, in which clients face fear in real life; (2) imaginal exposure, in which clients vividly imagine the fear-evoking stimulus; and (3) interoceptive exposure, which replicates physiological signs of anxiety ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)).

> This therapy also has several forms of pacing, including (1) graded exposure, in which treatment progresses through a client’s fear hierarchy; (2) flooding, which begins with the most fearful stimulus; and (3) systematic desensitization, which includes relaxation techniques ([APA-SCP, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib3)).

> VR exposure therapy (VRET) is a more convenient and cost-effective form of exposure therapy that uses well-crafted virtual environments (VEs) to elicit the sense of anxiety and presence that the client would experience during real exposures ([Botella et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib9); [Motraghi et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8742249/#bib36)).

Implications for Occupational Therapy Practice

> HMD-VR is a safe, affordable, and effective tool that can allow occupational therapy practitioners to simulate natural contexts in the clinic for activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and coping skills practice.

> HMD-VR interventions should include visual and auditory features to evoke a sense of presence, and other sensory features may not be necessary.

> VEs can be easily manipulated to optimize the congruence between the person and environment.

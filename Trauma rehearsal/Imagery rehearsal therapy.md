abstract

> A significant proportion of individuals having been exposed to a traumatic event will experience trauma-related nightmares and approximately 5% to 8% of the general population also report problems with nightmares. Chronic nightmares may represent a primary sleep disorder rather than a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, and direct targeting of nightmares is a feasible clinical approach to the problem. Many treatments for nightmares have been proposed, but there is much empirical support for cognitive-behavioral interventions such as imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT). This article details key components of IRT typically covered in 4 successive weekly therapy sessions and their underlying rationale. Particular attention is given to the importance of developing flexible applications based on variations in patients' needs and clinical history.

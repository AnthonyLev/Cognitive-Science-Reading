Rumination and worry are arguably the two most studied variants of Repetitive negative thinking (RNT). RNT definition : refers to the tendency to repeatedly dwell on negative situations, feelings and events (Ehring & Watkins, 2008). It has been identified as a core underlying cognitive mechanism in major depressive disorder and a number of anxiety disorders (Ehring et al., 2011; Ehring & Watkins, 2008). 

Rumination definition here : it refers to a passive, repetitive and evaluative focus on the causes, meanings and implications of depressive symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1998) whilst worry has been conceptualized as a ‘chain’ of repetitive and uncontrollable thoughts and images focused on possible future negative outcomes and the consequences of these (Borkovec, 1994). 
This study investigates how individuals experience these processes, which will provide insight into these common features of mental disorders and inform the development of an online intervention specifically targeting rumination and worry.
Our findings suggest that individuals are more familiar with the concept of worry than rumination, highlighting the importance of incorporating psychoeducation into treatment.
Participants often referenced positive and negative metacognitive beliefs about rumination and worry, suggesting there may be value in helping participants identify, evaluate, and modify these during treatment.
Treatment should incorporate strategies to address RNT late at night/in bed, as this was a high-risk time reported by the majority of participants.
Whilst cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has long been considered the gold-standard psychological treatment for depression and anxiety disorders (Cuijpers et al., 2008), preliminary findings suggest CBT may not completely resolve RNT (e.g. Jones et al., 2008; Schmaling et al., 2002). This may partially explain why a significant proportion of people do not respond to, or relapse, following standard CBT treatments, and why many continue to experience high levels of residual symptoms, particularly rumination (Dimidjian et al., 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012). Accordingly, clinical researchers have increasingly focused on developing and evaluating treatments specifically targeting these RNT processes in order to better prevent and reduce psychopathology, with promising findings to date (e.g. Teismann et al., 2014; Watkins et al., 2007; Watkins et al., 2011). Also promising are initial outcomes of trials evaluating the efficacy of internet-delivered interventions that simultaneously target both rumination and worry. The results indicate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing participants' levels of rumination and worry, and symptoms of depression and anxiety and suggest that the internet can be an effective mode of delivery for these targeted interventions (Cook et al., 2019; Topper et al., 2017). Delivering treatment via the internet is recognized to overcome a number of the barriers to accessing face-to-face treatment, with equivalent effectiveness (Andrews et al., 2010; Andrews et al., 2018). However, these existing internet-delivered interventions have so far only been evaluated in adolescents and young adults (under 25) without clinically significant depressive and/or generalized anxiety symptoms and have been focused on preventing rather than treating these disorders. 
We thus sought to develop an internet-delivered program specifically targeting rumination and worry and evaluate its acceptability and effectiveness in reducing rumination and worry in Australian adults

Consistent across the existing qualitative literature is the use of distraction as the most commonly reported attempt at stopping or interrupting rumination (Oliver et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008; Sloan et al., 2021).

A number of theories (e.g. Dugas et al., 1998; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Papageorgiou & Wells, 2001; Wells, 1995) suggest that RNT is initiated and reinforced by positive (e.g. ‘rumination helps me problem solve’) and negative (e.g. ‘my worrying is uncontrollable’) metacognitive beliefs. In support of these theories, metacognitive beliefs predict symptom maintenance and are associated with increased RNT frequency (Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 1997; Papageorgiou & Wells, 2001). Metacognitive beliefs have also been consistently reported by participants in existing qualitative studies exploring RNT (Oliver et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008; Sloan et al., 2021).

People's understanding and experience of RNT may influence their willingness to engage in treatment strategies and the acceptability of the intervention, a factor that has been implicated in adherence to online interventions (Christensen et al., 2009). Improving the relevance and relatability of the program has the potential to increase user engagement (e.g. Beatty & Binnion, 2016). It is thus critical that the information conveyed, language used, examples given and the strategies taught are relatable and relevant to end users of the program.

Participants endorsed worrying and/or ruminating about a number of different themes, the most common of which were personal relationships and past mistakes, negative experiences and conversations/social interactions. Our findings also provided insight into triggers for ruminating and/or worrying, with social situations/internal interactions and negative events/experiences were the most commonly reported triggers. 

Almost a third of participants reported that they had not heard of the term rumination before or were unsure if they had. This suggests that this term needs to be clearly defined in the intervention and highlights the benefit of incorporating psychoeducation into face-to-face and online treatments.

Participants reported most commonly ruminating and/or worrying about personal relationships, things they should have said or done, and past mistakes, negative experiences, conversations and social interactions. Rumination has been shown to prompt the recall of negative autobiographical memories (Wisco & Nolen-hoeksema, 2009), which may explain why participants frequently reported focusing on past experiences. 

Consistent with previous qualitative studies (Oliver et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008), the most commonly reported triggers for rumination and/or worry were social situations/interpersonal interactions and negative events/experiences. As noted by Oliver et al. (2015), this is likely because interpersonal stress has been shown to influence rumination (Hammen, 2006) and negative thoughts about the self are common after an interpersonal stressor (Hilt & Pollak, 2013). Clinicians and developers of treatment interventions can draw on these reported experiences, and the language that participants use to describe these experiences, to create relevant, real-world examples.

The language used by participants will also be incorporated into recruitment materials to better target those who ruminate and/or worry. Adopting the language and examples of potential end-users may help to improve the understanbluedability, relatability and acceptability of treatment. Furthermore, treatment engagement and adherence may also be improved if treatments better match the experiences of end-users (e.g. Beatty & Binnion, 2016).

Distraction and engaging in activities was the most commonly reported coping strategy to interrupt rumination and worry. As noted by Pearson et al. (2008), this may be indicative of the difficulty that individuals have controlling or stopping RNT using willpower alone and suggests that relying on external stimuli is a more effective coping strategy. Behavioural approaches focused on absorbing activities may then be useful and acceptable suggestions to interrupt rumination and worry. This could include behavioural activation (Jacobson et al., 2001) or absorption in ‘flow’ experiences (Watkins, 2016). The effectiveness of these suggested coping strategies will be explored when we evaluate the intervention program. As noted earlier, a third of participants were unsure about what typically triggered them to start ruminating and/or worrying. Interventions may thus also benefit from incorporating self-monitoring and helping users to create individualized formulations (e.g. functional analysis, Watkins, 2016).

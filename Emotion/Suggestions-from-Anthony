•	We need to define rumination to participants if we want to ask them if they still ruminate. Almost a third of participants reported that they had not heard of the term rumination before or were unsure if they had. This suggests that this term needs to be clearly defined in the intervention and highlights the benefit of incorporating psychoeducation into face-to-face and online treatments. https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjc.12367https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjc.12367. 
•	There may be value in helping participants identify, evaluate, and modify metacognitive beliefs about rumination during treatment. https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjc.12367 A number of theories (e.g. Dugas et al., 1998; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Papageorgiou & Wells, 2001; Wells, 1995) suggest that RNT is initiated and reinforced by positive (e.g. ‘rumination helps me problem solve’) and negative (e.g. ‘my worrying is uncontrollable’) metacognitive beliefs. In support of these theories, metacognitive beliefs predict symptom maintenance and are associated with increased Repetitive negative thinking frequency (Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 1997; Papageorgiou & Wells, 2001). Metacognitive beliefs have also been consistently reported by participants in existing qualitative studies exploring Repetitive negative thinking (Oliver et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008; Sloan et al., 2021).
•	existing internet-delivered interventions for rumination, which have been shown successful, have so far only been evaluated in adolescents and young adults (under 25) without clinically significant depressive and/or generalized anxiety symptoms and have been focused on preventing rather than treating these disorders. https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjc.12367 
•	People's understanding and experience of Repetitive negative thinking may influence their willingness to engage in treatment strategies and the acceptability of the intervention, a factor that has been implicated in adherence to online interventions (Christensen et al., 2009). Improving the relevance and relatability of the program has the potential to increase user engagement (e.g. Beatty & Binnion, 2016). It is thus critical that the information conveyed, language used, examples given and the strategies taught are relatable and relevant to end users of the program.
•	Treatment should incorporate strategies to address Repetitive negative thinking late at night/in bed, as this was a high-risk time reported by the majority of participants. https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjc.12367  
•	FYI : Consistent with previous qualitative studies (Oliver et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008), the most commonly reported triggers for rumination and/or worry were social situations/interpersonal interactions and negative events/experiences. As noted by Oliver et al. (2015), this is likely because interpersonal stress has been shown to influence rumination (Hammen, 2006) and negative thoughts about the self are common after an interpersonal stressor (Hilt & Pollak, 2013). 
•	FYI : Participants reported most commonly ruminating and/or worrying about personal relationships, things they should have said or done, and past mistakes, negative experiences, conversations and social interactions. Rumination has been shown to prompt the recall of negative autobiographical memories (Wisco & Nolen-hoeksema, 2009), which may explain why participants frequently reported focusing on past experiences.

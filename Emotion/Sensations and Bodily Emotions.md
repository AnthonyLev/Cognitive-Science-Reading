## Sensations and Bodily Emotions

### Where do emotions arise and perceived from?

>“The steadiness of the internal environment is the condition for a free and independent life” - Claude Bernard

>Major Theory —> Homeostatic deviations result in emotions

>Emotions serve as behavior drivers

### James Lange Theory of Emotions

>“The perception of bodily changes, as they occur, is the emotion”

>Emotions are experienced as causal result of physiological changes in the body
>

### Two Factor Theory by Schacter and Singer

>Emotions arise from physiological arousal and assigning cognitive labels

>Emotions result from two-stage process: physiological arousal, and cognitive appraisal of the environment.
>
>For e.g. fear is both physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal of some threat in the environment

### Sensation Vs Perception

>Sensation
>
>>Process of receiving infomation via our five sense, which can be experienced and interpreted by the brain
>>
>>Source is the stimuli obtained from sensory organs
>>
>>Results in perception
>>
>>A general biological procedure

>Perception
>
>>Process of interpreting the information acquired through the five senses accordingly
>>
>>Source is the information sent to the brain through sensation
>>
>>Results in iterpreting and giving meaning to the information received
>>
>>Has more psychological signifcance since the prerson's past experiences and ideologies affect directly

### Interoception: the sense of the internal state of the body

purpose: 

> (1) maintaining homeostatic conditions in the body  
>
> (2) self-awareness

examples:

> Hunger is a sensation that is governed by a set of brain structures (e.g., the hypothalamus) that are responsible for energy homeostasis.

> Pulmonary stretch receptors are found in the lungs and control the respiratory rate.

> Cardioception refers to the perception of the activity of the heart.

> Peripheral chemoreceptors in the brain monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the brain to give a feeling of suffocation if carbon dioxide levels get too high.

> Cutaneous receptors in the skin not only respond to touch, pressure, temperature and vibration, but also respond to vasodilation in the skin such as blushing.

> Sensory receptors in pharynx mucosa, similar to touch receptors in the skin, sense foreign objects such as food that may result in a gag reflex and corresponding gagging sensation.

> Stimulation of sensory receptors in the urinary bladder and rectum may result in sensations of fullness.

> Stimulation of stretch sensors that sense dilation of various blood vessels may result in pain, for example headache caused by vasodilation of brain arteries.

"A cohesive sense of self relies on cohesive sensory signals, our learning and memory rely on the body, and disembodiment is dangerous"

### Towards Emotion Prostheses

> Eliciting/Controlling targeted emotions as an emotion regulation paradigm

> Making immersive interactions, augmenting cognition

> Targeting mind-body disconnections for mental health and disorders

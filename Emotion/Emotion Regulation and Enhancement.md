abstract

> In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to help individuals regulate their emotions with mobile interventions that leverage the way we naturally react to our bodily signals. Previous studies demonstrate that the awareness of our bodily signals, such as our heart rate, directly influences the way we feel. By leveraging these findings we designed a wearable device to regulate user’s anxiety by providing a false feedback of a slow heart rate.

harmful emotion

>Emotions powerfully shape how we interact with the world around us. Most of the time our emotions serve us very well. In other situations emotions can harm more than help, such as when an individual ’freezes’ during a presentation or when a person is propelled to hit another during an episode of anger. In order to avoid these situations, we make efforts to regulate our emotions to make them helpful rather than harmful
